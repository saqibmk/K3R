# K3R
Koa - RethinkDB - React - Redux  = Awesome Stack (includes optional Redis) 

NOTE: This is a work in progress, Front end will be added soon.

Includes Mocha/Chai for Unit testing, and also includes Supertest for testing API end-points.
I'm also including a complete user: registration - email verification - login - password reset.


#To get it up and going:
npm install

Test using npm run test. Run server using npm start

Make sure you have rethinkDB and Redis running. The config folder contains files where the host and ports can be set.
